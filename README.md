## Entity Verification Process
Products can only be listed, changed, removed, viewed or interacted with in any way in the credit-coin network by parties who are considered *verified entities*. A verified entity is a participant in the network that has through some sort of vetting process. This 'trustless-ness' allows all parties to take full  advantage of the decentralized nature of the network.
